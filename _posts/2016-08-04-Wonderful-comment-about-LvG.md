One of the few positives about man utd's season was aside from Jesse Lingard establishing himself as a first team player, was the emergence of Rashford, Fosu mensah, but also borthwick Jackson, and varela.

These are young players who have taken on board the coaching they have received, and as a result have impressed once they got used to playing first team football. If van gaal stays, these players will all be part of the first team squad. If the manager changes, then you can wave goodbye to all but perhaps fosu mensah, because there is no earthly way that jose Mourinho would pick an 18 year old up front. He wouldn't use lukaku because he wasn't the finished product, and instead preferred to sign a very expensive Jorge Mendes finished product player in Diego Costa.

Essentially I want van gaal to stay, because I think he is a managerial genius, who has a fantastic way of getting teams to play with and without the ball. I firmly believe that if man utd hadn't had the worst injury crisis in their history this season, he'd have already got them playing that way, and there's very little wrong with them that having luke shaw for a full season wouldn't fix.

If he gets one more season, there's every chance that he will give man utd a settled and highly effective way of playing that the next manager can just build on. Like he did with Bayern Munich, and like he did over a longer period of time with Barcelona, and he'll finish overhauling the squad. Those are two crucial things for man utd, because they lost their way of playing under Moyes, and when vidic, evra, ferdinand, and giggs left just before van gaal arrived. But also man utd's activity in the summer of 2013 and 2014 could be summed up as Ed Woodward desperately trying to find literally anyone who would sign for Man utd. That is damage that needs to be repaired.

Man city have just appointed guardiola to try and teach them how to play the Barcajax way. he's never done that from scratch before, and has always managed at a club that van gaal managed at, so people would already be familiar with his methods. If Man utd give van gaal one more season, they might get there before City.

If you remember when Man utd played arsenal, their second goal came at the end of an 11 pass move, involving five first time passes pinged around midfield to suck arsenal in, before mata spun the ball wide to lingard, who drove at the centre of the goal, committed the left back, fed the ball to mata who flicked it out to varela who was arriving at the right moment, who laid it back to lingard, who had time to look up and see Mata running to the front post, Memphis running to the back post, and Rashford on the penalty spot waiting to attack the space.

Every single part of that goal was pure van gaal football. All four of rashford's first four goals were basically the same, with him adopting the same position in the Barcajax attacking triangle. If you watch barcelona or bayern, they always adopt this formation when the ball is crossed into the box. That is something that Van Gaal beat into them, against great resistance in some quarters.

The key player in that move though is Varela, as it allowed mata to play the ball back out wide, when lingard came inside. It meant that Arsenal were thrown off balance, and man utd had time to flood the box. Without the overlapping full back mata would have been forced to try a shot from the edge of the box through a crowd of players.

The thing is that Varela was involved in three goals that day, and three goals against midtylland (as well as completely shutting down alexis sanchez) after a period of time of getting used to playing first team football he was able to start overlapping effectively. And then almost immediately he was injured.

The point is this, no modern football team can attack properly without attacking full backs. That's how teams get around packed defences, because lumping in crosses and hoping that the big lad gets his head on them is a waste of everyone's time.

The really frustrating thing about this season is that most man utd fans think that Van Gaal is a boring negative coach, rather than the father of modern attacking football, and the main architect of Barcelona and Bayern's style of play.

(Cruyff was important, but if you're not playing 3-4-3 with a playmaker in front of the back three, then you're not a Cruyff team, you're a LVG team).

----------------------------------------

Let me reproduce a brilliant post by a Chappie called Greenmile who knows more football than the entire clueless anti-LVG brigade put together & that includes mindless & hateful hacks like Samuel Luckhurst of the Mirror & the Pundits (usually completely hopeless & utter managerial flops). It's a little long but the analysis is so spot on & clear that I have to reproduce it in its entirety, which is in 2 posts. Here goes:

"Louis Van Gaal is the manager who taught Barcelona to play their current way, and he is the manager who taught Bayern Munich to play their current way of playing. Everyone complained about how boring it all was, right up until the point where it all clicked, and those clubs went on the rampage.
He took over from the Moyes disaster, so last season was about seeing who he had available to him, and who he should keep, and somehow qualifying for the CL. This season he signed a bunch of players for particular positions, and things started like they did at bayern.

However the point where it all comes together and suddenly everyone realises how amazing everything is, hasn't arrived yet, because man utd have had to deal with the worst injury crisis in their history. Not because of injury prone players, or not because of over training, but because of players picking up a lot of long term injuries, after heavy tackles.
If Van Gaal gets fourth, despite the worst, and most prolonged injury crisis in the last 50 years of the club's history, then that will be an extraordinary achievement. It's very hard to get results in the premier league, try to teach a system of play, try to play attractive football, and deal with having at least 10 players out at all times between the start of december and the start of april. It reached 15 players when they lost to midtylland, and rose to 17 shortly afterwards.

To put that in context, the most players ever missing through injury under alex ferguson was 9, and it's worth noting that when man utd had 6 players out through injury under ferguson, they suffered. Leading to champions league group stage eliminations in 2005-6 and 2012-13. Now I know that people are inevitably going to say that every club has to deal with injuries etc, however this season has been very unusual for man utd in that they got a very high number of contact injuries, which are the sort of random injuries that you can do nothing about. No training could stop moreno from snapping shaw's leg like a twig, or koscielny breaking valencia's foot, or rojo and darmian dislocating their shoulders.

But the upshot of all this is that man utd were never able to get their fullbacks involved in attacking, because by the time they had gotten used to playing first team football, and got to grips with the defensive side of van gaal's system, and then started to do a bit of overlapping, performances would pick up, and they would immediately get injured, and man utd would have to start again. People then ask why can't man utd be consistent in their performance.

Man utd have had to field 8 different players at left back in the league, and they've had to field 7 different right backs, not because of fickleness on the manager's part, but because of injury. Yet somehow, they've kept clean sheets in half their league games. More than any other club in the league.

When Man utd lost to Bournemouth before christmas with two goals from corners, the man utd back four was Borthwick Jackson, Blind, McNair, and varela. Two of those players were making their first league starts for the club. In order for man utd to have to field that defence, Smalling, Shaw, Darmian, valencia, jones, rojo, and young had to all be injured.
Van Gaal has done such a good job at hiding the fact that man utd have been suffering a terrible defensive injury crisis all season, that people don't realise how bad things are, and don't realise how this affects their attacking.

Van gaal wants his full backs to play like wingers when man utd have the ball. that enables man utd to get to the byline, but also to get three forwards into the box, and allows man utd to get around the back of defences, and attack with up to six players. Without attacking full backs, man utd are attacking their opponents with only the front four, and it's much harder for those players to picked through the packed defences that you see in the premier league nowadays.

Van Gaal has given a lot of young players a chance this season. The two most impressive of them are players who have shown the greatest familiarity with van gaal's preferred system of playing. (Rashford's first four goals are all the same. He held his position on the penalty spot, as the full back overlapped and worked in the cross, and attacked the space created by the front post runs of mata, and the back post run of memphis. And Fosu Mensah has been playing this type of football since he was a small child, and has the ability to play in any of the back six positions equally well.
